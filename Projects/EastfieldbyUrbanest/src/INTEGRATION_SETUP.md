4. **Local Backup** - Data is stored in localStorage for backup

## üîê Security Note

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: The Google Form ID and webhook URL are visible in the frontend code. This is acceptable for Google Forms (they're meant to be public) and webhooks (they should have their own authentication).

For production use:
- Ensure your webhook endpoint validates requests
- Consider adding rate limiting to prevent spam
- Use HTTPS for all communications
- Never store sensitive data in localStorage

---

## üìû Support

All form submissions are now automatically sent to:
‚úÖ Google Forms (for spreadsheet tracking)
‚úÖ CRM Webhook (for automated lead processing)

If you need to modify the integration, edit `/config/forms-config.ts`
